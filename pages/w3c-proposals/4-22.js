      <H1>W3C Proposal 4.22: Motion Agnostic Movement</H1>
      <P>User Need 22: A person with a physical disability may want to participate within an immersive environment in a way that doesn't require particular bodily movement to perform any given action.</P>
      <P>REQ 22a: Allow the user performing an action in the environment, in a device independent way, without having to do so physically.</P>
      <P>REQ 22b: Ensure that all areas of the environment can be accessed without the need for a specific motion.</P>
      <P>NOTE: There are accessibility issues specific to physical movement. For example, the user may be expected to squat but may be physically unable to do so. A mechanism should be toggled by the user to inform the environment which motions the user is unable to perform. This should not impede on the userâ€™s ability to interact with the environment.</P>
